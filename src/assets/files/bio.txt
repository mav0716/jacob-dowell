My name is Jacob Dowell. I am a former soldier who served four years on active duty in the United States Army. My military career afforded me the opportunity to travel the world and represent our country as an ambassador. This experience exposed me to multiple cultures, enhancing my ability to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and collaborate effectively as a team member while creating strategic solutions.

Following my service, I pursued a degree in Computer Information Systems and developed a keen interest in software development, particularly in designing innovative software solutions that automate user interactions. My dedication as a student was evident as I immersed myself deeply in my coursework to build a solid educational foundation.

While studying, I also worked as a tutor for the CIS department, a role inspired by my passion for helping others overcome challenges similar to those I faced. My patience and understanding in explaining coding syntax and logic helped many students achieve their academic goals.

Currently, I am a software engineer at Charles Schwab, where I apply my skills in technology and teamwork to develop software solutions that enhance our clients' financial management capabilities. My journey from the military to tech exemplifies my adaptability and continuous growth in dynamic environments.
